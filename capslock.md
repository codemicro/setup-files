# Caps lock and escape switch

2021-05-02

Caps lock behaves as an extra ESC key (but ESC does not behave as caps lock).

1. Go to "System Settings" > "Keyboard" > "Layouts"
2. Select "English (UK)" then press "Options..."
3. Expand "Caps lock behaviour"
4. Select "Make caps lock an additional Esc"
